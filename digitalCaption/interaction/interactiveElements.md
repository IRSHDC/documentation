# Interactive Elements

Interaction with the DC app is straightforward. Though the aesthetic may change for the IRSHDC version of the DC app, the interactivity will remain relatively consistent.  

## Main Menu / Filtering
On the main menu, there are a few options for filtering the visible records. When an option is selected, common elements between the two filtered views will animate into place.

## Launching A Record
To launch a record, simply tap on any of the thumbnail previews.

{% video %}movies/launchRecord.mp4{% endvideo %}

> For the current VHEC version, only Artefacts and Themes were available to select from the main menu.

## Scrolling Images
Images will appear on the left-hand side of a record. If there are multiple images, the user can swipe or tap the left-right arrows to move between them.

## Image Viewer
Tapping on an image will launch a viewer that allows the user to zoom in and move through the image. Tapping a second time will return to the record.

{% video %}movies/imageViewer.mp4{% endvideo %}

## Scrolling Content
The content for a record is read dynmically and populated into a scrollview.

{% video %}movies/scrollContent.mp4{% endvideo %}

## Explore Further
To see related items to the current record, tap the *Explore Further* button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

{% video %}movies/exploreFurther.mp4{% endvideo %}

> If a record has no related items, the button will not appear.

## Submenu Filtering
The submenu has a slightly different behaviour than the main menu. When filtering is applied to a submenu, the non-selected elements become inactive and transparent.

{% video %}movies/submenuFiltering.mp4{% endvideo %}

## Movie Viewer
To view a movie, tap on a thumbnail that has a small play icon in its bottom-left corner.

{% video %}movies/watchMovie.mp4{% endvideo %}

> For the current VHEC version, movies are only shown as related items and launch directly from a submenu – there is no record associated with them.

## Open Records / Go Back
Opening a record will trigger a transition animation. When going back to the previous set of related records, there will be an inverse animation.

{% video %}movies/openRecordGoBack.mp4{% endvideo %}

## Home
The home button is persistent throughout the entire application. If the user presses home *and* the current record is one that is shown on the main menu, there will be an animation.

{% video %}movies/pressHome.mp4{% endvideo %}
