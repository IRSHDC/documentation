# Map Explorer Interaction
This section illustrates the interactive capabilities of the Map Explorer.

##Basics
There are 4 basic interactions.

###Panning
You can pan the map by dragging one or more fingers across the screen.

###Zooming
You can zoom in or out of the map by pinching the screen with two or more fingers.

{% video %}movies/me4.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Tapping
You can zoom into an area of the map by double-tapping the screen.

{% video %}movies/me5.mp4{% endvideo %}

##Lovely Features
Here we list a few lovely features in Map Explorer.

###Selecting
You can select an annotation by tapping on it – this launches a record.

{% video %}movies/me6.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Labels
If the "show labels" option is on in the filter panel, then each annotation will reveal its label after the user has sufficiently zoomed.

{% video %}movies/me9.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Scrolling Across Edges
If a user scrolls the map so the country moves past the left or right edges, the map will reappear at the opposite edge of the screen.

##Multi-User Control
The default behaviour for the Map Explorer is that when a single user interacts with the installation, all three screens will move in sync with that user's actions.

###Splitting by Screens
If a second user approaches the installation and starts controlling on another screen, then the installation will subdivide at the screen-level.

###Splitting a Single Screen
If two users start interacting with the same screen, on opposite sides of its exact center, the screen will act like it is 2 screens.

###Syncing
If a session has not been interacted with for a while its map will sync to the next-closest user's interaction.

##Centering
After 3 minutes of inactivity, the map will recenter to its screen.

### Single Screen
Here is what it looks like for a map to recenter.
