# Map Explorer Interaction
This section illustrates the interactive capabilities of the Map Explorer.

##Basics
There are 4 basic interactions.

###Panning
You can pan the map by dragging one or more fingers across the screen.

###Zooming

###Tapping

##Lovely Features
Here we list a few lovely features in Map Explorer.

###Selecting
You can select an annotation by tapping on it – this launches a record.

Screen.
{% video %}movies/ME_2_6_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Animating Back To a Pin
If a pin has already been tapped, and its record is still visible, the record will animate *back* to the pin instead of creating a copy of the record. 

{% video %}movies/ME_2_19_6.mp4{% endvideo %}

Two things to note here:

*First.* This only happens for pins that are touched on the same 1/2 screen session. For example, if the same pin is tapped on different halves of the screen, 2 identical records will show.

*Second.* Given the previous point. The same record can be shown up to 6 times across the entire installation.

###Flicking Records
Its possible to flick a record away. You can send it to someone on another screen, or just get it out of your hair.

###Flicking Off Screen
If a record is flicked off screen, or its header bar is no longer visible, then the record will be removed from the interface.

{% video %}movies/ME_2_21_2.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Labels
If the "show labels" option is on in the filter panel, then each annotation will reveal its label after the user has sufficiently zoomed.

Screen.
{% video %}movies/ME_2_9_1.mp4{% endvideo %}


###Scrolling Across Edges
If a user scrolls the map so the country moves past the left or right edges, the map will reappear at the opposite edge of the screen.

##Multi-User Control
The default behaviour for the Map Explorer is that when a single user interacts with the installation, all three screens will move in sync with that user's actions.

###Splitting by Screens
If a second user approaches the installation and starts controlling on another screen, then the installation will subdivide at the screen-level.

<!-- ME 3 13 -->

###Splitting a Single Screen
If two users start interacting with the same screen, on opposite sides of its exact center, the screen will act like it is 2 screens.

{% video %}movies/ME_2_7_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Taking Control
If a session is split and there is only a single person working with the installation, that person can tap the sync / split button to regain control of the installation.

{% video %}movies/ME_2_23_2.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Syncing
If a session has not been interacted with for a while its map will sync to the next-closest user's interaction.

##Centering
After 3 minutes of inactivity, the map will recenter to its screen.

### Single Screen 
Here is what it looks like for a map to recenter.

{% video %}movies/ME_2_14_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

### Single Screen – Multiple Sessions
Here is what it looks like when a split session recenters.

{% video %}movies/ME_2_15_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

### Multiple Screens
Here is what recentering looks like across multiple screens.

### Multiple Screens – Multiple Sessions
Here is what recentering looks like across multiple screens with multiple sessions.
