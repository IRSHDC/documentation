# User Interface

This section describes in detail the interface elements that a user will be able to access when interacting with the wall. Subsections are broken down into major components:

* Record Navigator
* User Menu
* Browse
* Relational Interface
* Map Explorer
* Timeline


## Map Explorer
The Map Explorer allows users to find records through their geographic location. Built off of Apple Maps, this  is an intuitive and familiar interface that makes it easy to search for Schools and Events across the country.

> Please see [Map Explorer](mapExplorer/mapExplorer.md)

## Browse
Where other interfaces are limited to accesing records by specific characteristics (e.g. map - geographic location, timeline - date, etc.) the browse interface is a simple mechanism that allows a user to access any record with only a few taps.

> Please see [Browse](browse/browse.md)
