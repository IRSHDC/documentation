# User Interface

This section describes in detail the interface elements that a user will be able to access when interacting with the wall. Subsections are broken down into major components:

* Record Navigator
* User Menu
* Browse
* Relational Interface
* Map Explorer
* Timeline

## Browse
Where other interfaces are limited to accesing records by specific characteristics (e.g. map - geographic location, timeline - date, etc.) the browse interface is a simple mechanism that allows a user to access any record with only a few taps.
