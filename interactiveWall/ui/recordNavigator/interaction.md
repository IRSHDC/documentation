## Records 

### Opening a Record
A record can be opened from any of the aesthetic layers – i.e. Map Explorer, Timeline, Node Visualizer. 

Here is an example of opening a record from the Map Explorer.

{% video %}../mapExplorer/movies/ME_1_6_2.mp4{% endvideo %}

Many records can be opened at the same time.

{% video %}../mapExplorer/movies/ME_2_6_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

### Move a Record
To move a record, a user can drag on it's title bar.

{% video %}/movies/RN_1_1_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

### Records fade away
After a record has sat idle for a while, it will fade away.

{% video %}/movies/RN_1_2_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

### Scrolling Text
Users can scroll to see more text. If the down arrow is visible at the bottom of the window, they can also tap to automatically move the text downwards.
