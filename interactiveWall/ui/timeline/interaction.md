# Timeline Interaction
This section illustrates the interactive capabilities of the Timeline.

##Basics
Interaction with the Timeline is essentially made up of 3 components: scrolling, tapping to open a record and pressing to see a trace of when a school opened and closed.

###Revealing
Pressing the timeline icon in the User Menu will reveal the timeline.

##Features

###Dragging Up / Down the Screen
Dragging on the background of the timeline will move it vertically along the screen.

###Highlight Duration
A trail will stay highlighted for a time and then revert to its original color.

###Seeing the End of a Trail
A school's trail will stay visible long enough that a user can scroll to the end to see when the school closed.

###Highlighting and Dragging
If a user highlights a school and doesn't remove their finger, they can start scrolling – this might be a rare occurrence, but it would essentially elongate the amount of time a trail is highlighted.

###Multiple Flag Highlight
Multiple flags can be pressed at the same time.

##Multiple Users
The Timeline can handle multiple users by splitting down in a fashion similar to the Map Explorer.

###Splitting for Multiple Users
Like the map explorer, the Timeline will split by screen and by 1/2 screen.

###Map + Timeline Split
If the Timeline is split and one user begins working with the Map Explorer, the map underneath the timeline will sync.
