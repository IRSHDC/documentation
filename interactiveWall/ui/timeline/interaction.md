# Timeline Interaction
This section illustrates the interactive capabilities of the Timeline.

##Basics
Interaction with the Timeline is essentially made up of 3 components: scrolling, tapping to open a record and pressing to see a trace of when a school opened and closed.

###Revealing
Pressing the timeline icon in the User Menu will reveal the timeline.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_1_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

If only one person is using the installation, the timeline will appear across all screens.

{% video %}movies/TL_3_1_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Scrolling
Dragging a finger across the screen will scroll the timeline horizontally.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_2_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

The timeline will scroll across multiple screens.

{% video %}movies/TL_3_2_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Year Bar Scrolling
Draging in the year-bar will scroll the timeline faster than dragging on its main view.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_3_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

{% video %}movies/TL_3_3_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Tapping to View A Record
Tapping a flag will reveal a record.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_4_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

{% video %}movies/TL_3_4_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Pressing to View Trail
Pressing and holding for a short period of time on a shcool's flag will cause its trail to be highlighted.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_6_4.mp4{% endvideo %}

{% video %}movies/TL_3_6_2.mp4{% endvideo %}

##Features

###Dragging Up / Down the Screen
Dragging on the background of the timeline will move it vertically along the screen.

###Highlight Duration
A trail will stay highlighted for a time and then revert to its original color.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_7_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Seeing the End of a Trail
A school's trail will stay visible long enough that a user can scroll to the end to see when the school closed.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_9_2.mp4{% endvideo %}

{% video %}movies/TL_3_9_2.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Highlighting and Dragging
If a user highlights a school and doesn't remove their finger, they can start scrolling – this might be a rare occurrence, but it would essentially elongate the amount of time a trail is highlighted.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_8_2.mp4{% endvideo %}

{% video %}movies/TL_3_8_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Multiple Flag Highlight
Multiple flags can be pressed at the same time.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_10_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

{% video %}movies/TL_3_10_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

##Multiple Users
The Timeline can handle multiple users by splitting down in a fashion similar to the Map Explorer.

###Splitting for Multiple Users
Like the map explorer, the Timeline will split by screen and by 1/2 screen.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_11_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

{% video %}movies/TL_3_11_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Map + Timeline Split
If the Timeline is split and one user begins working with the Map Explorer, the map underneath the timeline will sync.

{% video %}movies/TL_2_12_1.mp4{% endvideo %}

{% video %}movies/TL_3_12_2.mp4{% endvideo %}

###Timing Out from a Split
After the timeline has been split, it will rejoin another session if it hasn't been used in some time.
