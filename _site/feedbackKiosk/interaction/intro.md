# Interaction

This section is broken down into two parts: what you can do, and how you can get places.

## How You Can Get Places
The architecture section outlines the possible actions to get from one state to another. In total, there are 5 main types of screens, with menus that can have multiple and dynamic states.

## What You Can Do
The elements section describes the various actions a user can take, and provides videos to highlight those actions.
