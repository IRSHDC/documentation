# Timeline

This section covers the design, functionality and interaction of the Timeline.

## Design
The Timeline is in progress.

<!-- > Please see [Design](design.md) -->

## Interaction
Interaction with the Timeline is essentially made up of 3 components: scrolling, tapping to open a record and pressing to see a trace of when a school opened and closed.
