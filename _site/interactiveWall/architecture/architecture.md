# User Interface

This section describes in detail the interface elements that a user will be able to access when interacting with the wall. Subsections are broken down into major components:

* Record Navigator
* Map Explorer
* Timeline
* Relational Interface
* Browse
* User Menu

## Record Navigator
The Record Navigator is the common interface for accessing records, reading, and viewing media. Though it looks like it is called up out of an aesthetic layer – e.g. Map Explorer, Timeline, etc. – it is actually a standalone application. All record data is drawn from the IRSHDC database.

> Please see [Record Navigator](recordNavigator/recordNavigator.md)

## Map Explorer
The Map Explorer allows users to find records through their geographic location. Built off of Apple Maps, this  is an intuitive and familiar interface that makes it easy to search for Schools and Events across the country.

> Please see [Map Explorer](mapExplorer/mapExplorer.md)

## Timeline
The Timeline is a lovely implementation of a time-based visualization for schools and events.

> Please see [Timeline](timeline/timeline.md)

## Relational Interface (aka Node Visualizer)
The Relational Interface is a physics-based simulation that allows users to easily wander the database by means of visualizing the relationships between records.

<!-- > Please see [Relational Interface](nodeVisualizer/nodeVisualizer.md) -->

## Browse
Where other interfaces are limited to accesing records by specific characteristics (e.g. map - geographic location, timeline - date, etc.) the browse interface is a simple mechanism that allows a user to access any record with only a few taps.

> Please see [Browse](browse/browse.md)

## User Menu
A persistent menu is available at the left and right-hand edges of a screen. This menu allows the user to choose aesthetic layers, toggle variables, open the help / info panel, etc.

> Documentation Coming Soon
