# Digital Caption App

The Digital Caption (DC) App is a standalone iOS application that presents a user with an easy-to-navigate interface for:

* browsing through records, 
* watching videos,
* zooming into images, and 
* reading PDFs.

Commissioned by the IRSHDC, the original version of the DC app was architected and designed for the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre. 

> As of July 23, 2018, the design of the DC uses VHEC branding – **this will change**.
